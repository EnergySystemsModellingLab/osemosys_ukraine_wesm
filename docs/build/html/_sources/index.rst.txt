Ukraine WESM Model Docs documentation
=====================================

The Ukraine Whole Energy System Model (WESM) is a linear optimisation model of Ukraine’s entire energy system, developed 
using the OSeMOSYS framework. The model provides a detailed representation of the power and heat sector, while also covering 
all major demand‑driving sectors of the Ukrainian economy: agriculture, commercial and public services, industry, residential, 
and transport.

This documentation focuses on the Ukraine‑specific implementation of the WESM, while the full description of the OSeMOSYS 
modelling framework and its general methodology can be accessed on its `official webpage <https://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

# OSeMOSYS Ukraine Whole Energy System Model (WESM)

This repository hosts the **OSeMOSYS Ukraine Whole Energy System Model (WESM)**, developed under the **IAM Compact Project**.  
The model provides a comprehensive representation of Ukraineâ€™s energy system, covering the following sectors:  

- **Agriculture**  
- **Commerce**  
- **Industry**  
- **Residential**  
- **Transport**  

âš¡ *Note:* Energy storage technologies are **not included in the current version**.

The dataset was prepared using **Version 5.3 of the Modelling User Interface for OSeMOSYS (MUIO)**, developed by **UNDESA**, with the model file embedded in the same version of the interface.
